# Contribution Guide

Welcome to the Men of Machine Learning (MoML) project! We appreciate your interest in contributing to this educational resource. This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively and create a pull request.

## How to Contribute

If you believe you can contribute to any lesson in the MoML project, please follow these steps to ensure your contribution is added correctly:

### 1. **Create a Pull Request**

   To contribute, you will need to create a pull request (PR). Your PR should be formatted as follows:

   ```
   Day [Number] [Lesson Name]
   ```

   For example:
   ```
   Day 10 Types of Machine Learning – Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
   ```

### 2. **Determine What You Are Adding**

   Specify what you are adding to the project. This could include:
   
   - **Code Base**: If you are adding code, include relevant code files.
   - **Lesson Materials**: If you are adding lesson materials such as PDFs or other resources, make sure to include these files.

### 3. **Organize Your Files**

   - **Code Base**: Place all relevant code files into the `Lesson Code` folder. Inside this folder, find the appropriate day folder and add your files there.
   - **Lesson PDFs**: Place all lesson PDFs or similar materials into the `Lesson PDFs` folder. Similarly, find the relevant day folder and add your files there.

### 4. **Update the Folder README**

   Inside each day's folder, there is a `README.md` file. Please update this file with a detailed description of your lesson. Include:

   - **Overview**: A brief summary of the lesson.
   - **Objectives**: Key learning objectives.
   - **Details**: Any specific details or instructions related to your contribution.
   - **Additional Notes**: Any other relevant information that may be useful for the users.

### Example Folder Structure

```
/Lesson Code
  /Day 10
    lesson_code_file.py

/Lesson PDFs
  /Day 10
    lesson_material.pdf

/Day 10
  README.md (Update this with lesson details)
```

### Pull Request Template
